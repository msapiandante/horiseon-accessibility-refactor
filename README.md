# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

I was given starter codes to a website for a marketing agency with the goals of making it more accessible and optimizing it's potential for search engines. 
These goals were achieved by replacing all non-semantic elements with semeantic ones, adding alt attributes to all images. I also changed the title to include the name of the marketing agency and decided to include the three areas of specialty in order to optimize the agency popping up in search engine results. I learned a great deal about alt tags, HTML and CSS. 

## Credits
Many thanks to my mother Lani, mother in law Mayette, partner Kristin and my cats Pascal and Sammy in offering me SO much support as I change career paths and learn new skills.
